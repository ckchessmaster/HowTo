# CompleteApp

Basic vue3 frontend application that is secured via Auth0. This application was built following my OIDC/Oauth 2.0 tutorial [here](https://chriskingdon.com/2022/04/13/authentication-and-authorization-with-oauth-2-0-and-openid-connect-part-1-basic-authentication/).

## Project Setup

copy and rename src/auth/config.js.example to config.js and fill out the details with your own.

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the app with:
```sh
npm run dev
```
