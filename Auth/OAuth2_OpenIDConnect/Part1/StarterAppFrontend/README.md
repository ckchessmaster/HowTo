# CompleteApp

Basic vue3 frontend application. This application was built for my OIDC/Oauth 2.0 tutorial [here](https://chriskingdon.com/2022/04/13/authentication-and-authorization-with-oauth-2-0-and-openid-connect-part-1-basic-authentication/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install

Run the app with:

```
